An html5/css/js webapp that generates a random maze and lets the user explore it.

So far, the maze is simply generated and the user can walk around in 2D mode with arrow or vi keys.
There is a randomly placed 'goal tile' and the walls lighten/darken as the user gets closer to the 
goal - although the effect is too subtle right now.

Features planned:
Nicer graphics/more responsive layout
2d mode - restricted range of vision.
3d mode - 'wireframe' type maze exploration
