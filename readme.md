An html5/css/js webapp that generates a random maze and lets the user explore it.

So far, the maze is simply generated and the user can walk around in 2D mode with arrow or vi keys.

Features planned:
Nicer graphics/more responsive layout
Beginning and ending squares and feedback that lets the user know how far they are from the 
exit.
2d mode - restricted range of vision.
3d mode - 'wireframe' type maze exploration
