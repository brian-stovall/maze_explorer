An html5/css/js webapp that generates a random maze and lets the user explore it.

So far, the maze is generated and the user can walk around in 2D mode with arrow or vi keys.
A primitive menu lets the player choose between 3 different sizes and several modes of play.

Features planned:
Nicer graphics/more responsive layout
'fake 3d' mode - early 90's era "dungeon crawler" type maze exploration
